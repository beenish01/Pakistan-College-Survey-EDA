# Pakistan-College-Survey-EDA
This project aims to analyze education ratings across key Pakistani cities to identify areas needing improvement and to provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders. By examining ratings data, we aim to uncover patterns and underlying issues affecting education quality and propose targeted interventions to enhance education standards.


Data Overview
The dataset contains education ratings for various cities, with ratings ranging from 0 to 5 stars. The primary focus is on cities with higher counts of negative ratings (0 and 1 stars) to understand the specific challenges they face.

Key Findings
Cities with Higher Negative Ratings:

Lahore, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and Karachi have notably high counts of 0-star ratings, indicating significant issues that need to be addressed.

Needs Assessments:

Cities with high negative ratings likely face problems such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of trained teachers, and insufficient educational resources.

Positive Ratings:

Cities with higher positive ratings (4 and 5 stars) showcase successful strategies that can be replicated in other regions.

Teacher Training:

Cities like Rawalpindi and Sargodha, which have a higher number of schools but low ratings, highlight the need for enhanced teacher training programs.


Recommendations

Focus on Cities with Higher Negative Ratings (0 and 1):

Prioritize cities such as Lahore, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and Karachi for immediate intervention to address the underlying issues causing negative ratings.

Conduct Detailed Needs Assessments:

Perform in-depth assessments in cities with high negative ratings to understand specific problems such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of trained teachers, or insufficient educational resources. Tailor solutions to each city's unique challenges.

Promote Best Practices Across Cities:

Identify and replicate successful strategies from cities with higher positive ratings (4 and 5 stars). Sharing best practices can help uplift education standards in other cities.
